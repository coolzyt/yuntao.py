<P> The system-to-administrator ratio is commonly used as a rough
metric to understand administrative costs in high-scale services. With
smaller, less automated services this ratio can be as low as 2:1,
whereas on industry leading, highly automated services, we've seen
ratios as high as 2,500:1. Within Microsoft services, Autopilot [1] is
often cited as the magic behind the success of the Windows Live Search
team in achieving high system-to-administrator ratios. While auto-administration is important, the most important factor is actually the
service itself. Is the service efficient to automate?  Is it what we
refer to more generally as operations-friendly?  Services that are
operations-friendly require little human intervention, and both detect
and recover from all but the most obscure failures without
administrative intervention. This paper summarizes the best practices
accumulated over many years in scaling some of the largest services at
MSN and Windows Live.
<H1> Introduction </H1>

<P> This paper summarizes a set of best practices for designing and developing
operations-friendly services. This is a rapidly evolving subject area and,
consequently, any list of best practices will likely grow and morph over time.
Our aim is to help others
<UL>
<LI>
deliver operations-friendly services quickly and
<LI>
avoid the early morning phone calls and meetings with unhappy customers that
non-operations-friendly services tend to yield.
</UL>

<P> The work draws on our experiences over the last 20 years in high-scale
data-centric software systems and internet-scale services, most recently from
leading the Exchange Hosted Services team (at the time, a mid-sized service of
roughly 700 servers and just over 2.2M users). We also incorporate the
experiences of the Windows Live Search, Windows Live Mail, Exchange Hosted
Services, Live Communications Server, Windows Live Address Book Clearing House
(ABCH), MSN Spaces, Xbox Live, Rackable Systems Engineering Team, and the
Messenger Operations teams in addition to that of the overall Microsoft Global
Foundation Services Operations team. Several of these contributing services
have grown to more than a quarter billion users. The paper also draws heavily
on the work done at Berkeley on Recovery Oriented Computing [2, 3] and at
Stanford on Crash-Only Software [4, 5].

<P> Bill Hoffman [6] contributed many best practices to this paper, but also a
set of three simple tenets worth considering up front:
<UL>
<LI>
Expect failures. A component may crash or be stopped at any time. Dependent
components might fail or be stopped at any time. There will be network
failures. Disks will run out of space. Handle all failures gracefully.
<LI>
Keep things simple. Complexity breeds problems. Simple things are easier to
get right. Avoid unnecessary dependencies. Installation should be simple.
Failures on one server should have no impact on the rest of the data center.
<LI>
Automate everything. People make mistakes. People need sleep. People forget
things. Automated processes are testable, fixable, and therefore ultimately
much more reliable. Automate wherever possible.
</UL>

<P> These three tenets form a common thread throughout much of the discussion
that follows.

<H1> Recommendations </H1>

<P> This section is organized into ten sub-sections, each covering a different
aspect of what is required to design and deploy an operations-friendly
service. These sub-sections include overall service design; designing for
automation and provisioning; dependency management; release cycle and testing;
hardware selection and standardization; operations and capacity planning;
auditing, monitoring and alerting; graceful degradation and admission control;
customer and press communications plan; and customer self provisioning and
self help.

<H4> Overall Application Design </H4>

<P> We have long believed that 80% of operations issues originate in design
and development, so this section on overall service design is the largest and
most important. When systems fail, there is a natural tendency to look first
to operations since that is where the problem actually took place. Most
operations issues, however, either have their genesis in design and
development or are best solved there.

<P> Throughout the sections that follow, a consensus emerges that firm
separation of development, test, and operations isn't the most effective
approach in the services world. The trend we've seen when looking across many
services is that low-cost administration correlates highly with how closely
the development, test, and operations teams work together.

<P> In addition to the best practices on service design discussed here, the
subsequent section, "Designing for Automation Management and Provisioning,"
also has substantial influence on service design. Effective automatic
management and provisioning are generally achieved only with a constrained
service model. This is a repeating theme throughout: simplicity is the key to
efficient operations. Rational constraints on hardware selection, service
design, and deployment models are a big driver of reduced administrative costs
and greater service reliability.

<P> Some of the operations-friendly basics that have the biggest impact on
overall service design are:
<UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Design for failure</tt></b>. This is a core concept when developing
large services that comprise many cooperating components. Those components
will fail and they will fail frequently. The components don't always cooperate
and fail independently either. Once the service has scaled beyond 10,000
servers and 50,000 disks, failures will occur multiple times a day. If a
hardware failure requires any immediate administrative action, the service
simply won't scale cost-effectively and reliably. The entire service must be
capable of surviving failure without human administrative interaction. Failure
recovery must be a very simple path and that path must be tested frequently.
Armando Fox of Stanford [4, 5] has argued that the best way to test the
failure path is never to shut the service down normally. Just hard-fail it.
This sounds counter-intuitive, but if the failure paths aren't frequently
used, they won't work when needed [7].
<LI>
<b><tt>Redundancy and fault recovery</tt></b>. The mainframe model was to buy
one very large, very expensive server. Mainframes have redundant power
supplies, hot-swappable CPUs, and exotic bus architectures that provide
respectable I/O throughput in a single, tightly-coupled system. The obvious
problem with these systems is their expense. And even with all the costly
engineering, they still aren't sufficiently reliable. In order to get the
fifth 9 of reliability, redundancy is required. Even getting four 9's on a
single-system deployment is difficult. This concept is fairly well understood
industry-wide, yet it's still common to see services built upon fragile, non-redundant data tiers.  Designing a service such that any system can crash (or
be brought down for service) at any time while still meeting the service level
agreement (SLA) requires careful engineering. The acid test for full
compliance with this design principle is the following: is the operations team
willing and able to bring down any server in the service at any time without
draining the work load first? If they are, then there is synchronous
redundancy (no data loss), failure detection, and automatic take-over. As a
design approach, we recommend one commonly used approach to find and correct
potential service security issues: security threat modeling. In security
threat modeling [8], we consider each possible security threat and, for each,
implement adequate mitigation. The same approach can be applied to designing
for fault resiliency and recovery.  Document all conceivable component
failures modes and combinations thereof. For each failure, ensure that the
service can continue to operate without unacceptable loss in service quality,
or determine that this failure risk is acceptable for this particular service
(e.g., loss of an entire data center in a non-geo-redundant service). Very
unusual combinations of failures may be determined sufficiently unlikely that
ensuring the system can operate through them is uneconomical. Be cautious when
making this judgment. We've been surprised at how frequently "unusual"
combinations of events take place when running thousands of servers that
produce millions of opportunities for component failures each day. Rare
combinations can become commonplace.
<LI>
<b><tt>Commodity hardware slice</tt></b>. All components of the service should
target a commodity hardware slice. For example, storage-light servers will be
dual socket, 2- to 4-core systems in the $1,000 to $2,500 range with a boot
disk. Storage-heavy servers are similar servers with 16 to 24 disks. The key
observations are:
<UL>
<LI>
large clusters of commodity servers are much less expensive than the small
number of large servers they replace,
<LI>
server performance continues to increase much faster than I/O performance,
making a small server a more balanced system for a given amount of disk,
<LI>
power consumption scales linearly with servers but cubically with clock
frequency, making higher performance servers more expensive to operate, and
<LI>
a small server affects a smaller proportion of the overall service workload
when failing over.
</UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Single-version software</tt></b>. Two factors that make some services
less expensive to develop and faster to evolve than most packaged products are
<UL>
<LI>
the software needs to only target a single internal deployment and
<LI>
previous versions don't have to be supported for a decade as is the case for
enterprise-targeted products.
</UL> Single-version software is relatively easy to achieve with a consumer
service, especially one provided without charge. But it's equally important
when selling subscription-based services to non-consumers. Enterprises are
used to having significant influence over their software providers and to
having complete control over when they deploy new versions (typically slowly).
This drives up the cost of their operations and the cost of supporting them
since so many versions of the software need to be supported.  The most
economic services don't give customers control over the version they run, and
only host one version. Holding this single-version software line requires
<UL>
<LI>
care in not producing substantial user experience changes release-to-release
and
<LI>
a willingness to allow customers that need this level of control to either
host internally or switch to an application service provider willing to
provide this people-intensive multi-version support.
</UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Multi-tenancy</tt></b>. Multi-tenancy is the hosting of all companies
or end users of a service in the same service without physical isolation,
whereas single tenancy is the segregation of groups of users in an isolated
cluster. The argument for multi-tenancy is nearly identical to the argument
for single version support and is based upon providing fundamentally lower
cost of service built upon automation and large-scale.
</UL>

<P> In review, the basic design tenets and considerations we have laid out
above are:
<UL>
<LI>
design for failure,
<LI>
implement redundancy and fault recovery,
<LI>
depend upon a commodity hardware slice,
<LI>
support single-version software, and
<LI>
enable multi-tenancy.
</UL> We are constraining the service design and operations model to maximize
our ability to automate and to reduce the overall costs of the service. We
draw a clear distinction between these goals and those of application service
providers or IT outsourcers. Those businesses tend to be more people intensive
and more willing to run complex, customer specific configurations.

<P> More specific best practices for designing operations-friendly services
are:
<UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Quick service health check</tt></b>. This is the services version of a
build verification test. It's a sniff test that can be run quickly on a
developer's system to ensure that the service isn't broken in any substantive
way. Not all edge cases are tested, but if the quick health check passes, the
code can be checked in.
<LI>
<b><tt>Develop in the full environment</tt></b>. Developers should be unit
testing their components, but should also be testing the full service with
their component changes. Achieving this goal efficiently requires single-server deployment (section 2.4), and the preceding best practice, a quick
service health check.
<LI>
<b><tt>Zero trust of underlying components</tt></b>. Assume that underlying
components will fail and ensure that components will be able to recover and
continue to provide service. The recovery technique is service-specific, but
common techniques are to
<UL>
<LI>
continue to operate on cached data in read-only mode or
<LI>
continue to provide service to all but a tiny fraction of the user base during
the short time while the service is accessing the redundant copy of the failed
component.
</UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Do not build the same functionality in multiple components</tt></b>.
Foreseeing future interactions is hard, and fixes have to be made in multiple
parts of the system if code redundancy creeps in. Services grow and evolve
quickly. Without care, the code base can deteriorate rapidly.
<LI>
<b><tt>One pod or cluster should not affect another pod or cluster</tt></b>.
Most services are formed of pods or sub-clusters of systems that work together
to provide the service, where each pod is able to operate relatively
independently. Each pod should be as close to 100% independent and without
inter-pod correlated failures. Global services even with redundancy are a
central point of failure. Sometimes they cannot be avoided but try to have
everything that a cluster needs inside the clusters.
<LI>
<b><tt>Allow (rare) emergency human intervention</tt></b>. The common scenario
for this is the movement of user data due to a catastrophic event or other
emergency. Design the system to never need human interaction, but understand
that rare events will occur where combined failures or unanticipated failures
require human interaction. These events will happen and operator error under
these circumstances is a common source of catastrophic data loss. An
operations engineer working under pressure at 2 a.m. will make mistakes.
Design the system to first not require operations intervention under most
circumstances, but work with operations to come up with recovery plans if they
need to intervene. Rather than documenting these as multi-step, error-prone
procedures, write them as scripts and test them in production to ensure they
work. What isn't tested in production won't work, so periodically the
operations team should conduct a "fire drill" using these tools. If the
service-availability risk of a drill is excessively high, then insufficient
investment has been made in the design, development, and testing of the tools.
<LI>
<b><tt>Keep things simple and robust</tt></b>. Complicated algorithms and
component interactions multiply the difficulty of debugging, deploying, etc.
Simple and nearly stupid is almost always better in a high-scale service-the
number of interacting failure modes is already daunting before complex
optimizations are delivered. Our general rule is that optimizations that bring
an order of magnitude improvement are worth considering, but percentage or
even small factor gains aren't worth it.
<LI>
<b><tt>Enforce admission control at all levels</tt></b>. Any good system is
designed with admission control at the front door. This follows the long-understood principle that it's better to not let more work into an overloaded
system than to continue accepting work and beginning to thrash. Some form of
throttling or admission control is common at the entry to the service, but
there should also be admission control at all major components boundaries.
Work load characteristic changes will eventually lead to sub-component
overload even though the overall service is operating within acceptable load
levels. See the note below in section 2.8 on the "big red switch" as one way
of gracefully degrading under excess load. The general rule is to attempt to
gracefully degrade rather than hard failing and to block entry to the service
before giving uniform poor service to all users.
<LI>
<b><tt>Partition the service</tt></b>. Partitions should be infinitely-adjustable and fine-grained, and not be bounded by any real world entity
(person, collection...). If the partition is by company, then a big company
will exceed the size of a single partition. If the partition is by name
prefix, then eventually all the P's, for example, won't fit on a single
server. We recommend using a look-up table at the mid-tier that maps fine-grained entities, typically users, to the system where their data is managed.
Those fine-grained partitions can then be moved freely between servers.
<LI>
<b><tt>Understand the network design</tt></b>. Test early to understand what
load is driven between servers in a rack, across racks, and across data
centers.  Application developers must understand the network design and it
must be reviewed early with networking specialists on the operations team.
<LI>
<b><tt>Analyze throughput and latency</tt></b>. Analysis of the throughput and
latency of core service user interactions should be performed to understand
impact. Do so with other operations running such as regular database
maintenance, operations configuration (new users added, users migrated),
service debugging, etc. This will help catch issues driven by periodic
management tasks. For each service, a metric should emerge for capacity
planning such as user requests per second per system, concurrent on-line users
per system, or some related metric that maps relevant work load to resource
requirements.
<LI>
<b><tt>Treat operations utilities as part of the service</tt></b>. Operations
utilities produced by development, test, program management, and operations
should be code-reviewed by development, checked into the main source tree, and
tracked on the same schedule and with the same testing. Frequently these
utilities are mission critical and yet nearly untested.
<LI>
<b><tt>Understand access patterns</tt></b>. When planning new features, always
consider what load they are going to put on the backend store. Often the
service model and service developers become so abstracted away from the store
that they lose sight of the load they are putting on the underlying database.
A best practice is to build it into the specification with a section such as,
"What impacts will this feature have on the rest of the infrastructure?"
Then measure and validate the feature for load when it goes live.
<LI>
<b><tt>Version everything</tt></b>. Expect to run in a mixed-version
environment. The goal is to run single version software but multiple versions
will be live during rollout and production testing. Versions n and n+1 of all
components need to coexist peacefully.
<LI>
<b><tt>Keep the unit/functional tests from the previous release</tt></b>.
These tests are a great way of verifying that version n-1 functionality
doesn't get broken. We recommend going one step further and constantly running
service verification tests in production (more detail below).
<LI>
<b><tt>Avoid single points of failure</tt></b>. Single points of failure will
bring down the service or portions of the service when they fail. Prefer
stateless implementations. Don't affinitize requests or clients to specific
servers. Instead, load balance over a group of servers able to handle the
load. Static hashing or any static work allocation to servers will suffer from
data and/or query skew problems over time. Scaling out is easy when machines
in a class are interchangeable. Databases are often single points of failure
and database scaling remains one of the hardest problems in designing
internet-scale services. Good designs use fine-grained partitioning and don't
support cross-partition operations to allow efficient scaling across many
database servers. All database state is stored redundantly (on at least one)
fully redundant hot standby server and failover is tested frequently in
production.
</UL>

<H4> Automatic Management and Provisioning </H4>

<P> Many services are written to alert operations on failure and to depend
upon human intervention for recovery. The problem with this model starts with
the expense of a 24x7 operations staff. Even more important is that if
operations engineers are asked to make tough decisions under pressure, about
20% of the time they will make mistakes. The model is both expensive and
error-prone, and reduces overall service reliability.

<P> Designing for automation, however, involves significant service-model
constraints. For example, some of the large services today depend upon
database systems with asynchronous replication to a secondary, back-up server.
Failing over to the secondary after the primary isn't able to service requests
loses some customer data due to replicating asynchronously. However, not
failing over to the secondary leads to service downtime for those users whose
data is stored on the failed database server. Automating the decision to fail
over is hard in this case since its dependent upon human judgment and
accurately estimating the amount of data loss compared to the likely length of
the down time. A system designed for automation pays the latency and
throughput cost of synchronous replication. And, having done that, failover
becomes a simple decision: if the primary is down, route requests to the
secondary. This approach is much more amenable to automation and is
considerably less error prone.

<P> Automating administration of a service after design and deployment can be
very difficult. Successful automation requires simplicity and clear, easy-to-make operational decisions. This in turn depends on a careful service design
that, when necessary, sacrifices some latency and throughput to ease
automation. The trade-off is often difficult to make, but the administrative
savings can be more than an order of magnitude in high-scale services. In
fact, the current spread between the most manual and the most automated
service we've looked at is a full two orders of magnitude in people costs.

<P> Best practices in designing for automation include:
<UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Be restartable and redundant</tt></b>. All operations must be
restartable and all persistent state stored redundantly.
<LI>
<b><tt>Support geo-distribution</tt></b>. All high scale services should
support running across several hosting data centers. In fairness, automation
and most of the efficiencies we describe here are still possible without geo-distribution. But lacking support for multiple data center deployments drives
up operations costs dramatically. Without geo-distribution, it's difficult to
use free capacity in one data center to relieve load on a service hosted in
another data center. Lack of geo-distribution is an operational constraint
that drives up costs.
<LI>
<b><tt>Automatic provisioning and installation</tt></b>. Provisioning and
installation, if done by hand, is costly, there are too many failures, and
small configuration differences will slowly spread throughout the service
making problem determination much more difficult.
<LI>
<b><tt>Configuration and code as a unit</tt></b>. Ensure that
<UL>
<LI>
the development team delivers the code and the configuration as a single unit,
<LI>
the unit is deployed by test in exactly the same way that operations will
deploy it, and
<LI>
operations deploys them as a unit.
</UL> Services that treat configuration and code as a unit and only change
them together are often more reliable.  If a configuration change must be made
in production, ensure that all changes produce an audit log record so it's
clear what was changed, when and by whom, and which servers were effected (see
section 2.7). Frequently scan all servers to ensure their current state
matches the intended state. This helps catch install and configuration
failures, detects server misconfigurations early, and finds non-audited server
configuration changes.
<LI>
<b><tt>Manage server roles or personalities rather than servers</tt></b>.
Every system role or personality should support deployment on as many or as
few servers as needed.
<LI>
<b><tt>Multi-system failures are common</tt></b>. Expect failures of many
hosts at once (power, net switch, and rollout). Unfortunately, services with
state will have to be topology-aware. Correlated failures remain a fact of
life.
<LI>
<b><tt>Recover at the service level</tt></b>. Handle failures and correct
errors at the service level where the full execution context is available
rather than in lower software levels. For example, build redundancy into the
service rather than depending upon recovery at the lower software layer.
<LI>
<b><tt>Never rely on local storage for non-recoverable information</tt></b>.
Always replicate all the non-ephemeral service state.
<LI>
<b><tt>Keep deployment simple</tt></b>. File copy is ideal as it gives the
most deployment flexibility. Minimize external dependencies. Avoid complex
install scripts. Anything that prevents different components or different
versions of the same component from running on the same server should be
avoided.
<LI>
<b><tt>Fail services regularly</tt></b>. Take down data centers, shut down
racks, and power off servers. Regular controlled brown-outs will go a long way
to exposing service, system, and network weaknesses. Those unwilling to test
in production aren't yet confident that the service will continue operating
through failures. And, without production testing, recovery won't work when
called upon.
</UL>

<H4> Dependency Management </H4>

<P> Dependency management in high-scale services often doesn't get the
attention the topic deserves. As a general rule, dependence on small
components or services doesn't save enough to justify the complexity of
managing them. Dependencies do make sense when:
<UL>
<LI>
the components being depended upon are substantial in size or complexity, or
<LI>
the service being depended upon gains its value in being a single, central
instance.
</UL> Examples of the first class are storage and consensus algorithm
implementations. Examples of the second class of are identity and group
management systems. The whole value of these systems is that they are a
single, shared instance so multi-instancing to avoid dependency isn't an
option.

<P> Assuming that dependencies are justified according to the above rules,
some best practices for managing them are:
<UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Expect latency</tt></b>. Calls to external components may take a long
time to complete. Don't let delays in one component or service cause delays in
completely unrelated areas. Ensure all interactions have appropriate timeouts
to avoid tying up resources for protracted periods. Operational idempotency
allows the restart of requests after timeout even though those requests may
have partially or even fully completed. Ensure all restarts are reported and
bound restarts to avoid a repeatedly failing request from consuming ever more
system resources.
<LI>
<b><tt>Isolate failures</tt></b>. The architecture of the site must prevent
cascading failures. Always "fail fast." When dependent services fail, mark
them as down and stop using them to prevent threads from being tied up waiting
on failed components.
<LI>
<b><tt>Use shipping and proven components</tt></b>. Proven technology is
almost always better than operating on the bleeding edge. Stable software is
better than an early copy, no matter how valuable the new feature seems. This
rule applies to hardware as well. Stable hardware shipping in volume is almost
always better than the small performance gains that might be attained from
early release hardware.
<LI>
<b><tt>Implement inter-service monitoring and alerting</tt></b>. If the
service is overloading a dependent service, the depending service needs to
know and, if it can't back-off automatically, alerts need to be sent. If
operations can't resolve the problem quickly, it needs to be easy to contact
engineers from both teams quickly. All teams with dependencies should have
engineering contacts on the dependent teams.
<LI>
<b><tt>Dependent services require the same design point</tt></b>. Dependent
services and producers of dependent components need to be committed to at
least the same SLA as the depending service.
<LI>
<b><tt>Decouple components</tt></b>. Where possible, ensure that components
can continue operation, perhaps in a degraded mode, during failures of other
components. For example, rather than re-authenticating on each connect,
maintain a session key and refresh it every N hours independent of connection
status. On reconnect, just use existing session key. That way the load on the
authenticating server is more consistent and login storms are not driven on
reconnect after momentary network failure and related events.
</UL>

<H4> Release Cycle and Testing </H4>

<P> Testing in production is a reality and needs to be part of the quality
assurance approach used by all internet-scale services. Most services have at
least one test lab that is as similar to production as (affordably) possible
and all good engineering teams use production workloads to drive the test
systems realistically. Our experience has been, however, that as good as these
test labs are, they are never full fidelity. They always differ in at least
subtle ways from production. As these labs approach the production system in
fidelity, the cost goes asymptotic and rapidly approaches that of the
production system.

<P> We instead recommend taking new service releases through standard unit,
functional, and production test lab testing and then going into limited
production as the final test phase. Clearly we don't want software going into
production that doesn't work or puts data integrity at risk, so this has to be
done carefully. The following rules must be followed:
<UL>
<LI>
the production system has to have sufficient redundancy that, in the event of
catastrophic new service failure, state can be quickly be recovered,
<LI>
data corruption or state-related failures have to be extremely unlikely
(functional testing must first be passing),
<LI>
errors must be detected and the engineering team (rather than operations) must
be monitoring system health of the code in test, and
<LI>
it must be possible to quickly roll back all changes and this roll back must
be tested before going into production.
</UL>

<P> This sounds dangerous. But we have found that using this technique
actually improves customer experience around new service releases. Rather than
deploying as quickly as possible, we put one system in production for a few
days in a single data center. Then we bring one new system into production in
each data center. Then we'll move an entire data center into production on the
new bits. And finally, if quality and performance goals are being met, we
deploy globally. This approach can find problems before the service is at risk
and can actually provide a better customer experience through the version
transition. Big-bang deployments are very dangerous.

<P> Another potentially counter-intuitive approach we favor is deployment mid-day rather than at night. At night, there is greater risk of mistakes. And, if
anomalies crop up when deploying in the middle of the night, there are fewer
engineers around to deal with them. The goal is to minimize the number of
engineering and operations interactions with the system overall, and
especially outside of the normal work day, to both reduce costs and to
increase quality.

<P> Some best practices for release cycle and testing include:
<UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Ship often</tt></b>. Intuitively one would think that shipping more
frequently is harder and more error prone. We've found, however, that more
frequent releases have less big-bang changes. Consequently, the releases tend
to be higher quality and the customer experience is much better. The acid test
of a good release is that the user experience may have changed but the number
of operational issues around availability and latency should be unchanged
during the release cycle. We like shipping on 3-month cycles, but arguments
can be made for other schedules. Our gut feel is that the norm will eventually
be less than three months, and many services are already shipping on weekly
schedules. Cycles longer than three months are dangerous.
<LI>
<b><tt>Use production data to find problems</tt></b>. Quality assurance in a
large-scale system is a data-mining and visualization problem, not a testing
problem. Everyone needs to focus on getting the most out of the volumes of
data in a production environment. A few strategies are:
<UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Measurable release criteria</tt></b>. Define specific criteria around
the intended user experience, and continuously monitor it. If availability is
supposed to be 99%, measure that availability meets the goal. Both alert and
diagnose if it goes under.
<LI>
<b><tt>Tune goals in real time</tt></b>. Rather than getting bogged down
deciding whether the goal should be 99% or 99.9% or any other goal, set an
acceptable target and then ratchet it up as the system establishes stability
in production.
<LI>
<b><tt>Always collect the actual numbers</tt></b>. Collect the actual metrics
rather than red and green or other summary reports. Summary reports and graphs
are useful but the raw data is needed for diagnosis.
<LI>
<b><tt>Minimize false positives</tt></b>. People stop paying attention very
quickly when the data is incorrect. It's important to not over-alert or
operations staff will learn to ignore them. This is so important that hiding
real problems as collateral damage is often acceptable.
<LI>
<b><tt>Analyze trends</tt></b>. This can be used for predicting problems. For
example, when data movement in the system diverges from the usual rate, it
often predicts a bigger problem. Exploit the available data.
<LI>
<b><tt>Make the system health highly visible</tt></b>. Require a globally
available, real-time display of service health for the entire organization.
Have an internal website people can go at any time to understand the current
state of the service.
<LI>
<b><tt>Monitor continuously</tt></b>. It bears noting that people must be
looking at all the data every day. Everyone should do this, but make it the
explicit job of a subset of the team to do this.
</UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Invest in engineering</tt></b>. Good engineering minimizes operational
requirements and solves problems before they actually become operational
issues. Too often, organizations grow operations to deal with scale and never
take the time to engineer a scalable, reliable architecture. Services that
don't think big to start with will be scrambling to catch up later.
<LI>
<b><tt>Support version roll-back</tt></b>. Version roll-back is mandatory and
must be tested and proven before roll-out. Without roll-back, any form of
production-level testing in very high risk. Reverting to the previous version
is a rip cord that should always be available on any deployment.
<LI>
<b><tt>Maintain forward and backward compatibility</tt></b>.  This vital point
strongly relates to the previous one. Changing file formats, interfaces,
logging/ debugging, instrumentation, monitoring and contact points between
components are all potential risk. Don't rip out support for old file formats
until there is no chance of a roll back to that old format in the future.
<LI>
<b><tt>Single-server deployment</tt></b>. This is both a test and development
requirement. The entire service must be easy to host on a single system. Where
single-server deployment is impossible for some component (e.g., a dependency
on an external, non-single box deployable service), write an emulator to allow
single-server testing. Without this, unit testing is difficult and doesn't
fully happen. And if running the full system is difficult, developers will
have a tendency to take a component view rather than a systems view.
<LI>
<b><tt>Stress test for load</tt></b>. Run some tiny subset of the production
systems at twice (or more) the load to ensure that system behavior at higher
than expected load is understood and that the systems don't melt down as the
load goes up.
<LI>
<b><tt>Perform capacity and performance testing prior to new
releases</tt></b>. Do this at the service level and also against each
component since work load characteristics will change over time. Problems and
degradations inside the system need to be caught early.
<LI>
<b><tt>Build and deploy shallowly and iteratively</tt></b>. Get a skeleton
version of the full service up early in the development cycle. This full
service may hardly do anything at all and may include shunts in places but it
allows testers and developers to be productive and it gets the entire team
thinking at the user level from the very beginning. This is a good practice
when building any software system, but is particularly important for services.
<LI>
<b><tt>Test with real data</tt></b>. Fork user requests or workload from
production to test environments. Pick up production data and put it in test
environments. The diverse user population of the product will always be most
creative at finding bugs. Clearly, privacy commitments must be maintained so
it's vital that this data never leak back out into production.
<LI>
<b><tt>Run system-level acceptance tests</tt></b>. Tests that run locally
provide sanity check that speeds iterative development. To avoid heavy
maintenance cost they should still be at system level.
<LI>
<b><tt>Test and develop in full environments</tt></b>. Set aside hardware to
test at interesting scale. Most importantly, use the same data collection and
mining techniques used in production on these environments to maximize the
investment.
</UL>

<H4> Hardware Selection and Standardization </H4>

<P> The usual argument for SKU standardization is that bulk purchases can save
considerable money. This is inarguably true. The larger need for hardware
standardization is that it allows for faster service deployment and growth. If
each service is purchasing their own private infrastructure, then each service
has to:
<UL>
<LI>
determine which hardware currently is the best cost/performing option,
<LI>
order the hardware, and
<LI>
do hardware qualification and software deployment once the hardware is
installed in the data center.
</UL> This usually takes a month and can easily take more.

<P> A better approach is a "services fabric" that includes a small number of
hardware SKUs and the automatic management and provisioning infrastructure on
which all service are run. If more machines are needed for a test cluster,
they are requested via a web service and quickly made available. If a small
service gets more successful, new resources can be added from the existing
pool. This approach ensures two vital principles:
<UL>
<LI>
all services, even small ones, are using the automatic management and
provisioning infrastructure and
<LI>
new services can be tested and deployed much more rapidly.
</UL>

<P> Best practices for hardware selection include:
<UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Use only standard SKUs</tt></b>. Having a single or small number of
SKUs in production allows resources to be moved fluidly between services as
needed. The most cost-effective model is to develop a standard service-hosting
framework that includes automatic management and provisioning, hardware, and a
standard set of shared services. Standard SKUs is a core requirement to
achieve this goal.
<LI>
<b><tt>Purchase full racks</tt></b>. Purchase hardware in fully configured and
tested racks or blocks of multiple racks. Racking and stacking costs are
inexplicably high in most data centers, so let the system manufacturers do it
and wheel in full racks.
<LI>
<b><tt>Write to a hardware abstraction</tt></b>. Write the service to an
abstract hardware description. Rather than fully exploiting the hardware SKU,
the service should neither exploit that SKU nor depend upon detailed knowledge
of it. This allows the 2-way, 4-disk SKU to be upgraded over time as better
cost/performing systems come available. The SKU should be a virtual
description that includes number of CPUs and disks, and a minimum for memory.
Finer-grained information about the SKU should not be exploited.
<LI>
<b><tt>Abstract the network and naming</tt></b>. Abstract the network and
naming as far as possible, using DNS and CNAMEs. Always, always use a CNAME.
Hardware breaks, comes off lease, and gets repurposed. Never rely on a machine
name in any part of the code. A flip of the CNAME in DNS is a lot easier than
changing configuration files, or worse yet, production code. If you need to
avoid flushing the DNS cache, remember to set Time To Live sufficiently low to
ensure that changes are pushed as quickly as needed.
</UL>

<H4> Operations and Capacity Planning </H4>

<P> The key to operating services efficiently is to build the system to
eliminate the vast majority of operations administrative interactions. The
goal should be that a highly-reliable, 24x7 service should be maintained by a
small 8x5 operations staff.

<P> However, unusual failures will happen and there will be times when systems
or groups of systems can't be brought back on line. Understanding this
possibility, automate the procedure to move state off the damaged systems.
Relying on operations to update SQL tables by hand or to move data using ad
hoc techniques is courting disaster. Mistakes get made in the heat of battle.
Anticipate the corrective actions the operations team will need to make, and
write and test these procedures up-front. Generally, the development team
needs to automate emergency recovery actions and they must test them. Clearly
not all failures can be anticipated, but typically a small set of recovery
actions can be used to recover from broad classes of failures. Essentially,
build and test "recovery kernels" that can be used and combined in different
ways depending upon the scope and the nature of the disaster.

<P> The recovery scripts need to be tested in production. The general rule is
that nothing works if it isn't tested frequently so don't implement anything
the team doesn't have the courage to use. If testing in production is too
risky, the script isn't ready or safe for use in an emergency. The key point
here is that disasters happen and it's amazing how frequently a small disaster
becomes a big disaster as a consequence of a recovery step that doesn't work
as expected. Anticipate these events and engineer automated actions to get the
service back on line without further loss of data or up time.
<UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Make the development team responsible</tt></b>. Amazon is perhaps the
most aggressive down this path with their slogan "you built it, you manage
it." That position is perhaps slightly stronger than the one we would take,
but it's clearly the right general direction. If development is frequently
called in the middle of the night, automation is the likely outcome. If
operations is frequently called, the usual reaction is to grow the operations
team.
<LI>
<b><tt>Soft delete only</tt></b>. Never delete anything. Just mark it deleted.
When new data comes in, record the requests on the way. Keep a rolling two
week (or more) history of all changes to help recover from software or
administrative errors. If someone makes a mistake and forgets the where clause
on a delete statement (it has happened before and it will again), all logical
copies of the data are deleted. Neither RAID nor mirroring can protect against
this form of error. The ability to recover the data can make the difference
between a highly embarrassing issue or a minor, barely noticeable glitch. For
those systems already doing off-line backups, this additional record of data
coming into the service only needs to be since the last backup. But, being
cautious, we recommend going farther back anyway.
<LI>
<b><tt>Track resource allocation</tt></b>. Understand the costs of additional
load for capacity planning. Every service needs to develop some metrics of use
such as concurrent users online, user requests per second, or something else
appropriate. Whatever the metric, there must be a direct and known correlation
between this measure of load and the hardware resources needed. The estimated
load number should be fed by the sales and marketing teams and used by the
operations team in capacity planning. Different services will have different
change velocities and require different ordering cycles. We've worked on
services where we updated the marketing forecasts every 90 days, and updated
the capacity plan and ordered equipment every 30 days.
<LI>
<b><tt>Make one change at a time</tt></b>. When in trouble, only apply one
change to the environment at a time. This may seem obvious, but we've seen
many occasions when multiple changes meant cause and effect could not be
correlated.
<LI>
<b><tt>Make everything configurable</tt></b>. Anything that has any chance of
needing to be changed in production should be made configurable and tunable in
production without a code change. Even if there is no good reason why a value
will need to change in production, make it changeable as long as it is easy to
do. These knobs shouldn't be changed at will in production, and the system
should be thoroughly tested using the configuration that is planned for
production. But when a production problem arises, it is always easier, safer,
and much faster to make a simple configuration change compared to coding,
compiling, testing, and deploying code changes.
</UL>

<H4> Auditing, Monitoring and Alerting </H4>

<P> The operations team can't instrument a service in deployment. Make
substantial effort during development to ensure that performance data, health
data, throughput data, etc. are all produced by every component in the system.

<P> Any time there is a configuration change, the exact change, who did it,
and when it was done needs to be logged in the audit log. When production
problems begin, the first question to answer is what changes have been made
recently. Without a configuration audit trail, the answer is always
"nothing" has changed and it's almost always the case that what was
forgotten was the change that led to the question.

<P> Alerting is an art. There is a tendency to alert on any event that the
developer expects they might find interesting and so version-one services
often produce reams of useless alerts which never get looked at. To be
effective, each alert has to represent a problem. Otherwise, the operations
team will learn to ignore them. We don't know of any magic to get alerting
correct other than to interactively tune what conditions drive alerts to
ensure that all critical events are alerted and there are not alerts when
nothing needs to be done. To get alerting levels correct, two metrics can help
and are worth tracking:
<UL>
<LI>
alerts-to-trouble ticket ratio (with a goal of near one), and
<LI>
number of systems health issues without corresponding alerts (with a goal of
near zero).
</UL>

<P> Best practices include:
<UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Instrument everything</tt></b>. Measure every customer interaction or
transaction that flows through the system and report anomalies. There is a
place for "runners" (synthetic workloads that simulate user interactions
with a service in production) but they aren't close to sufficient. Using
runners alone, we've seen it take days to even notice a serious problem, since
the standard runner workload was continuing to be processed well, and then
days more to know why.
<LI>
<b><tt>Data is the most valuable asset</tt></b>. If the normal operating
behavior isn't well-understood, it's hard to respond to what isn't. Lots of
data on what is happening in the system needs to be gathered to know it really
is working well. Many services have gone through catastrophic failures and
only learned of the failure when the phones started ringing.
<LI>
<b><tt>Have a customer view of service</tt></b>. Perform end-to-end testing.
Runners are not enough, but they are needed to ensure the service is fully
working. Make sure complex and important paths such as logging in a new user
are tested by the runners. Avoid false positives. If a runner failure isn't
considered important, change the test to one that is. Again, once people
become accustomed to ignoring data, breakages won't get immediate attention.
<LI>
<b><tt>Instrument for production testing</tt></b>. In order to safely test in
production, complete monitoring and alerting is needed. If a component is
failing, it needs to be detected quickly.
<LI>
<b><tt>Latencies are the toughest problem</tt></b>. Examples are slow I/O and
not quite failing but processing slowly. These are hard to find, so instrument
carefully to ensure they are detected.
<LI>
<b><tt>Have sufficient production data</tt></b>. In order to find problems,
data has to be available. Build fine-grained monitoring in early or it becomes
expensive to retrofit later. The most important data that we've relied upon
includes:
<UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Use performance counters for all operations</tt></b>. Record the
latency of operations and number of operations per second at the least. The
waxing and waning of these values is a huge red flag.
<LI>
<b><tt>Audit all operations</tt></b>. Every time somebody does something,
especially something significant, log it. This serves two purposes: first, the
logs can be mined to find out what sort of things users are doing (in our
case, the kind of queries they are doing) and second, it helps in debugging a
problem once it is found.  <i>A related point</i>: this won't do much good if
everyone is using the same account to administer the systems. A very bad idea
but not all that rare.
<LI>
<b><tt>Track all fault tolerance mechanisms</tt></b>. Fault tolerance
mechanisms hide failures. Track every time a retry happens, or a piece of data
is copied from one place to another, or a machine is rebooted or a service
restarted. Know when fault tolerance is hiding little failures so they can be
tracked down before they become big failures. We had a 2000-machine service
fall slowly to only 400 available over the period of a few days without it
being noticed initially.
<LI>
<b><tt>Track operations against important entities</tt></b>. Make an "audit
log" of everything significant that has happened to a particular entity, be
it a document or chunk of documents. When running data analysis, it's common
to find anomalies in the data. Know where the data came from and what
processing it's been through. This is particularly difficult to add later in
the project.
<LI>
<b><tt>Asserts</tt></b>. Use asserts freely and throughout the product.
Collect the resulting logs or crash dumps and investigate them. For systems
that run different services in the same process boundary and can't use
asserts, write trace records. Whatever the implementation, be able to flag
problems and mine frequency of different problems.
<LI>
<b><tt>Keep historical data</tt></b>. Historical performance and log data is
necessary for trending and problem diagnosis.
</UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Configurable logging</tt></b>. Support configurable logging that can
optionally be turned on or off as needed to debug issues. Having to deploy new
builds with extra monitoring during a failure is very dangerous.
<LI>
<b><tt>Expose health information for monitoring</tt></b>. Think about ways to
externally monitor the health of the service and make it easy to monitor it in
production.
<LI>
<b><tt>Make all reported errors actionable</tt></b>. Problems will happen.
Things will break. If an unrecoverable error in code is detected and logged or
reported as an error, the error message should indicate possible causes for
the error and suggest ways to correct it. Un-actionable error reports are not
useful and, over time, they get ignored and real failures will be missed.
<LI>
<b><tt>Enable quick diagnosis of production problems</tt></b>.
<UL>
<LI>
<b><tt>Give enough information to diagnose</tt></b>. When problems are
flagged, give enough information that a person can diagnose it. Otherwise the
barrier to entry will be too high and the flags will be ignored. For example,
don't just say "10 queries returned no results." Add "and here is the list,
and the times they happened."
<LI>
<b><tt>Chain of evidence</tt></b>. Make sure that from beginning to end there
is a path for developer to diagnose a problem. This is typically done with
logs.
<LI>
<b><tt>Debugging in production</tt></b>. We prefer a model where the systems
are almost never touched by anyone including operations and that debugging is
done by snapping the image, dumping the memory, and shipping it out of
production. When production debugging is the only option, developers are the
best choice. Ensure they are well trained in what is allowed on production
servers. Our experience has been that the less frequently systems are touched
in production, the happier customers generally are. So we recommend working
very hard on not having to touch live systems still in production.
<LI>
<b><tt>Record all significant actions</tt></b>. Every time the system does
something important, particularly on a network request or modification of
data, log what happened. This includes both when a user sends a command and
what the system internally does. Having this record helps immensely in
debugging problems. Even more importantly, mining tools can be built that find
out useful aggregates, such as, what kind of queries are users doing (i.e.,
which words, how many words, etc.)
</UL>
</UL>

<H4> Graceful Degradation and Admission Control </H4>

<P> There will be times when DOS attacks or some change in usage patterns
causes a sudden workload spike. The service needs be able to degrade
gracefully and control admissions. For example, during 9/11 most news services
melted down and couldn't provide a usable service to any of the user base.
Reliably delivering a subset of the articles would have been a better choice.
Two best practices, a "big red switch" and admission control, need to be
tailored to each service. But both are powerful and necessary.
<UL>
<LI>
<b>Support a "big red switch."</b> The idea of the "big red switch"
originally came from Windows Live Search and it has a lot of power. We've
generalized it somewhat in that more transactional services differ from Search
in significant ways. But the idea is very powerful and applicable anywhere.
Generally, a "big red switch" is a designed and tested action that can be
taken when the service is no longer able to meet its SLA, or when that is
imminent. Arguably referring to graceful degradation as a "big red switch"
is a slightly confusing nomenclature but what is meant is the ability to shed
non-critical load in an emergency.  The concept of a big red switch is to keep
the vital processing progressing while shedding or delaying some non-critical
workload. By design, this should never happen, but it's good to have recourse
when it does. Trying to figure these out when the service is on fire is risky.
If there is some load that can be queued and processed later, it's a candidate
for a big red switch. If it's possible to continue to operate the transaction
system while disabling advance querying, that's also a good candidate. The key
thing is determining what is minimally required if the system is in trouble,
and implementing and testing the option to shut off the non-essential services
when that happens. Note that a correct big red switch is reversible. Resetting
the switch should be tested to ensure that the full service returns to
operation, including all batch jobs and other previously halted non-critical
work.
<LI>
<b>Control admission</b>. The second important concept is admission control.
If the current load cannot be processed on the system, bringing more work load
into the system just assures that a larger cross section of the user base is
going to get a bad experience. How this gets done is dependent on the system
and some can do this more easily than others. As an example, the last service
we led processed email. If the system was over-capacity and starting to queue,
we were better off not accepting more mail into the system and let it queue at
the source. The key reason this made sense, and actually decreased overall
service latency, is that as our queues built, we processed more slowly. If we
didn't allow the queues to build, throughput would be higher. Another
technique is to service premium customers ahead of non-premium customers, or
known users ahead of guests, or guests ahead of users if "try and buy" is
part of the business model.
<LI>
<b>Meter admission</b>. Another incredibly important concept is a modification
of the admission control point made above. If the system fails and goes down,
be able to bring it back up slowly ensuring that all is well. It must be
possible to let just one user in, then let in 10 users/second, and slowly ramp
up. It's vital that each service have a fine-grained knob to slowly ramp up
usage when coming back on line or recovering from a catastrophic failure. This
capability is rarely included in the first release of any service.  Where a
service has clients, there must be a means for the service to inform the
client that it's down and when it might be up. This allows the client to
continue to operate on local data if applicable, and getting the client to
back-off and not pound the service can make it easier to get the service back
on line. This also gives an opportunity for the service owners to communicate
directly with the user (see below) and control their expectations. Another
client-side trick that can be used to prevent them all synchronously hammering
the server is to introduce intentional jitter and per-entity automatic backup.
</UL>

<H4> Customer and Press Communication Plan </H4>

<P> Systems fail, and there will be times when latency or other issues must be
communicated to customers. Communications should be made available through
multiple channels in an opt-in basis: RSS, web, instant messages, email, etc.
For those services with clients, the ability for the service to communicate
with the user through the client can be very useful. The client can be asked
to back off until some specific time or for some duration. The client can be
asked to run in disconnected, cached mode if supported. The client can show
the user the system status and when full functionality is expected to be
available again.

<P> Even without a client, if users interact with the system via web pages for
example, the system state can still be communicated to them. If users
understand what is happening and have a reasonable expectation of when the
service will be restored, satisfaction is much higher. There is a natural
tendency for service owners to want to hide system issues but, over time,
we've become convinced that making information on the state of the service
available to the customer base almost always improves customer satisfaction.
Even in no-charge systems, if people know what is happening and when it'll be
back, they appear less likely to abandon the service.

<P> Certain types of events will bring press coverage. The service will be
much better represented if these scenarios are prepared for in advance. Issues
like mass data loss or corruption, security breach, privacy violations, and
lengthy service down-times can draw the press. Have a communications plan in
place. Know who to call when and how to direct calls. The skeleton of the
communications plan should already be drawn up. Each type of disaster should
have a plan in place on who to call, when to call them, and how to handle
communications.

<H4> Customer Self-Provisioning and Self-Help </H4>

<P> Customer self-provisioning substantially reduces costs and also increases
customer satisfaction. If a customer can go to the web, enter the needed data
and just start using the service, they are happier than if they had to waste
time in a call processing queue. We've always felt that the major cell phone
carriers miss an opportunity to both save and improve customer satisfaction by
not allowing self-service for those that don't want to call the customer
support group.

<H1> Conclusion </H1>

<P> Reducing operations costs and improving service reliability for a high
scale internet service starts with writing the service to be operations-friendly. In this document we define operations-friendly and summarize best
practices in service design, development, deployment, and operation from
engineers working on high-scale services.
